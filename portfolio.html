<h2> 
    Informatics Skunkworks
</h2>

<p>
    Here is my undergraduate research with Dr. Ben Afflerbach and Professor Dane Morgan, where we
    assessed, analyzed, and finetuned a Crystal Diffusion Variational AutoEncoder to create new material based on a specified property.
    My group's property is band gap, a property used to determine electric conductivity.

<h2> 
    MySQL Filesystem
</h2>

<p>
    As Scrum Master, I managed a team that created a MySQL based file system that allows users
    to create an account and upload, view, edit, and change permissions of files

<p>
   My teammates and I developed an Android Mobile Apple that allows students with visual impairments to study
   by using Speech to Text to record Study Decks and Flash Cards to study

<h2> 
    Author Detection
</h2>

<p>
  Along with my teammates, Leo Xu and Ivan Micanovic, we applied different data augmentation methods 
  to a known model called "GhostBusters", a model used to detect AI-Generated text. We applied these data augmentation
  methods to see if we could improve the model's ability to detect AI-Generated text, specifically in school environments
  where there is large ethical Concerns using LLMs, such as ChatGPT, to write essays.

<h2> 
    Hospital Map
</h2>

<p>
    In my CS400: Data Structures and Algorithms class, I led a group to design and implement a project called Hospital Maps.
    This program finds the shortest path between one hospital to another based on 
    a list of hospitals that we have in our 'database'.

<h2> 
    Search Engine
</h2>

<p>
   In CS106A, a class I took during Stanford Summer School before my senior year of high school,
   I implement a search engine algorithm to look up files based on key words
