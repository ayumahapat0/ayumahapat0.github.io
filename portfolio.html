    assesing generative machine learning models to create new material based on a specified property.
    My group's property is band gap.

<h2> 
    Hospital Map
</h2>

<p>
    In my CS400: Data Structures and Algorithms class, I led a group to design and implement a project called Hospital Maps.
    This program finds the shortest path between one hospital to another based on 
    a list of hospitals that we have in our 'database'.
