    I went to New York with my family during December 2022. It was my first time being in New York
    since I was a little kid.
</p>

<p>
    The food there was excellent. We finally got to try New York Style pizza. Even though the pizza was cold,
    the pizza was still very good! In addition, we ate different crossiants in the shape of cubes and even disks!
     My favorite were these Asian Crispy Spicy Chicken Wings.
</p>

    Here are some of the pictures of the food

    My two favorite places we visisted were Times Square and Wax Musuem. In Times Square, we got to see
    all the different billboards and extremely tall buildings. It was also my first experience eating Shake Shack! 
    The Wax Museum had so many different figures of different pop culture figures, from musical artists, movie stars, comic book characters,
    and even famous political figures!

    Here are some of my favorite moments from those places!
