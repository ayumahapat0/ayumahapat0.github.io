    During my junior year of high school, I did my solo piano recital in front of my friends and family.
    It was an amalgamation of all favorite pieces that I had learned over my time from learning from Dr. Kate Camara.

    I started playing piano when I was 9 years old when my parents, with my knowledge, had signed me up to piano lession to someone
    just a 5 minute walk away from the house. At first, I was disinterested in playing and put forth no effort in practice before my
    weekly lessons. The lessons were going no where until I started hearing other pianists on youtube and seeing them play these difficult,
    but beautiful pieces. I love to take on different challenges because not just to prove to myself I can do it, but I love the satisfaction
    of overcoming them. It gives me the confidence to pursue any other difficult endeavor I will inevitably face in my life. Every since then 
    I started practicing and practicing and the rest is history. Through piano, I was able to learn about self-expression and put my emotions on 
    my sleeve. Even though they did it without my knowledge, my glad my parents did. But I don't want to give them that satisfaction ;).

    I participated in many different piano recitals, such as a group performance in tufts University. In addition, I learned many different 
    classical, contemporary, video game, and movie music that I would learn to master. This performance is my favorite because it represents
    my love for piano and music. Here below are all the pieces from the performances.

    Here is a presentation of all my performances!
