    During my junior year of high school, I did my solo piano recital in front of my friends and family.
    It was an amalgamation of all favorite pieces that I had learned during my time with my instructor, Dr. Kate Camara.

    I started playing piano when I was 9 years old when my parents, without my knowledge, signed me up for lessons with someone living 5 minutes from out house.
    At first, I was disinterested in playing and put forth no effort in practice before my weekly lessons. 
    The lessons were going no where until I started hearing other pianists on Youtube and seeing them play these difficult,
    but beautiful pieces. I love taking on new challenges; proving to myself that I am capable of overcoming them fives me great satisfaction.
    It gives me the confidence to pursue any other difficult endeavor I will inevitably face in my life. Ever since then 
    I started practicing and practicing and the rest is history. Through piano, I was able to learn about self-expression and put my emotions on 
    my sleeve. Although they did it without my knowledge, I'm glad my parents signed me up for lessons. But I don't want to give them that satisfaction, though ;).

    I participated in many different piano recitals, such as a group performance in tufts University. In addition, I learned many different 
    classical, contemporary, video game, and movie music that I would learn to master. This performance is my favorite because it represents
    my love for piano and music. Here below are all the pieces from the performances.

    Here is a presentation of all pieces from my solo recital!
