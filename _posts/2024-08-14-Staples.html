<h2>
    Intro
</h2>

<p>
    During the summer of 2024, I got accepted into Staples Internship program as a Software Engineering Intern in the Staples Digital Solutions division.
    As a SWE intern, I worked under the Order to Cash Team, which is a part of their Financial Services Team. 
</p>

​​<h2>
    My Team
</h2>
 
 
 <p>
    I loved working with my team! My manager was Tanu Khanna, who did an amazing job of making me feel comfortable and get acclimated with Staples workflow and culture. My mentor
    during this internship was Thuccy Nyguen, who had previously gone through this internship program. She was wonderful in helping me Debug my code and
    understand Staples Technology stack. Another person who assisted me was my project partner, Ramya Akkipali, who was integral in deloading the work for my project.
 </p>
 
 
 <h2>
   My Project
 </h2>
 
 
 <p>
   At Staples, they are moving away from physical hardware to storing information and are now using Microsoft Azure Services. One
   of the services that Staples utilizes is the Microsoft Azure Service Bus. The Service Bus is a software tool that holds Message
   Queues. These queues hold messages in specific formats, such as XML, JSON, or regular Text. Staples is using this Azure Service
   in order to receive messages about warranty activation or cancellation of third party technology projects from Apple, HP, and Brother.
 </p>

 <p>
   The goal of my project was to migrate Staples warranty activation and cancellation service to shift from using XML messages
   and use the Ingram Micro Reseller API to notify Ingram Micro to either create this warranty activation or cancel it for HP. The warranty activation
   and cancellation program was a Spring Boot Microservice.
 </p>

</div> 

 <p>
    The Service Bus receives an xml message to either activate or cancel warranty of an HP product. This message contains many business details, such as
    business unit, transaction type, address to ship to, etc. This message is sent to the Warranty Request messaging queue. This message is then consumed
    by Staples' warranty request process Spring Boot Microservice that then validates the request and then saves the transaction details, services, address,
    and header details in Staple's Database. 
 </p>

 <p>
    This Microservice then sends a message to the Warranty Activation queue, which is then consumed by Staples warranty
    activation Microservice. The Microservice then calls utilizes the Ingram Micro Reseller API to either activate or cancel warranty for an HP product, depending
    on the request. Finally, the response from the API is then saved into Staple's Database.

 <h2>
    Reflection of Project + Internship Experience
 </h2>
 
 
 <p>
    This was my first time working with Springboot, so it was a learning curve understand how to utilize feign clients, Spring Boot Beans, Web Security, as well as understanding
    Springboot's unique advantage of autoconfiguration. In addition, I learned about how to use an API that uses Oauth2.0 client credential security flow. It was also
    my first time using Microsoft Azure services, so it was amazing to learn and use such advanced and effective software technology that will continue to be used in the future,
    and I am grateful that Staples provided me with a comfortable environment to challenge my technology skills and improved them. In the end, I got to curate a presentation in front
    of Matt Johnson, CIO of Staples, my manager, my mentor, and many other leaders in Staple's Digital Solutions Division.
 </p>

 <p>
    Staples also provided 'Career Readiness Sessions', which were information sessions where learned many important skills and concepts for our future careers,
    such as Networking, Interview and presentation skills, emotional intelligence, Resume crafting, and etc. Getting exclusive information to these skill sets
    has prepared me well for my career moving forward.
