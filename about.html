    My name is Ayush Mahapatra and I am a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Data Science.
</p>

<p>
    My passion in Computer Science lies in Software Engineering specifically Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 
    I am a part of the Informatics Skunkworks club where I am currently researching under Dr. Ben Afflerbach and Professor Dane Morgan. 
    The club allows students to gain knowledge through research in Data Informatics, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning in conjunction with Material Science. 
    Our Research Project under Dr. Ben Afflerbach is about Generative Machine Learning Models. Currently, we are analyzing a Crystal Diffusion Variational Auto Encoder that
    generates over 10,000 new materials with the goal of optimizing bandgap to improve electric conductivity.
    The world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is growing and I am excited to learn even more about it!

    In addition, I am working in Staples' Digital Solutions division, working with the Financial Services team as a Software Engineering Intern. During this internship, I developed
    a feign client for a Spring Boot Microservice using Oauth2.0 secured RESTful APIs to activate or cancel warranty for all future HP Products that
    Staples sells. From this experience, I have learned even more about the Software Development cycle, how to prepare presentations and demos, and how to truly work and collaborate with people with different 
    backgrounds and technological skills. I am grateful for the opportunity to improving my software development skills, along with helping 
    Staples continue their quota of efficient and reliable distribution of Techonology, Resources, and Services!

    I am actively looking for a Software Engineering job! I have taken advanced courses such as Artificial Intelligence, Matrix Methods in Machine Learning, Operating Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Discrete Mathematics. I have developed skills in Python, Java, C, HTML, Javascript, NumPy, PyTorch, Git, Pandas, and Windows.

    In my spare time, I practice taekwondo, play piano, learn to bake different desserts!
