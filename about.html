<p>
    My name is Ayush Mahapatra and I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Minor in Data Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
</p>

<p>
    My passion in Computer Science lies in Software Engineering, with specific interests in Software Development, machine learning, and Artificial Intelligence. 
    I was a part of the Informatics Skunkworks club where I was researching under Dr. Ben Afflerbach and Professor Dane Morgan. 
    The club allows students to gain knowledge through research in Data Informatics, Artificial Intelligence, and machine learning in conjunction with Material Science. 
    Our Research Project under Dr. Ben Afflerbach is about Generative Machine Learning Models. During my time, we were analyzing a Crystal Diffusion Variational Auto Encoder that
    generates over 10,000 new materials with the goal of optimizing bandgap to improve electric conductivity.
    The world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is growing and I am excited to learn even more about it!

    In addition, I was a Backend Software Engineering Intern in Staples' Digital Solutions division, working with the Financial Services team as a Software Engineering Intern. During this internship, I developed
    a Spring Boot Microservice using Oauth2.0 secured RESTful APIs to activate or cancel warranty for all future Apple, HP, and Brother Products that
    Staples sells. From this experience, I have learned even more about the Software Development cycle, how to prepare presentations and demos, and how to truly work and collaborate with people with different 
    backgrounds and technological skills. I am grateful for the opportunity to improving my software development skills, along with helping 
    Staples continue their quota of efficient and reliable distribution of Techonology, Resources, and Services!
