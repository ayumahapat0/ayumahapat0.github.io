<p>
    My name is Ayush Mahapatra and I am a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Data Science.
</p>

<p>
    My passion in Computer Science lies in Software Engineering specifically Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 
    I am currently a part of the Informatics Skunkworks club where I am currently researching under Dr. Ben Afflerbach and Professor Dane Morgan. 
    The club allows students to gain knowledge through research in Data Informatics, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning in conjunction with Material Sciences. 
    Our Research Project under Dr. Ben Afflerbach is about Generative Machine Learning Models. 
    The world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is growing and I am excited to learn even more about it.

    I am actively looking for a Software Engineering job! I have taken advanced courses such as Artificial Intelligence, Operating Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Discrete Mathematics. I have developed skills in Python, Java, C, HTML, Javascript, NumPy, PyTorch, Git, Pandas, and Windows.

    In my spare time, I practice taekwondo, play piano, learn to bake different desserts!
