<p>
    My name is Ayush Mahapatra and I am a student at the University Wisconsin-Madison pursuing my bachelors in Computer Science and a minor in 
    Data Science.

<p>
    My passion in Computer Science lies in Software Engineering and specificially Machine Learning and Aritifical Intelligence.  
    I am currently a part of the Informatics Skunkworks club where I am currently researching under Dr. Ben Afflerbach and Professor Dane Morgan. 
    The club allows students to gain knowledge through research of Data Informatics, Artifical Intelligence, and Machine Learning in conjucture 
    with Material Sciences. Our Research Project under Dr. Ben Afflerbach is about Generative Machine Learning Models. The world 
    of Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning is growing and I am excited to learn even more about it.

    I am actively looking for an internship for summer 2024! I have taken advanced course such as Artifical Intelligence, Operating System,
    Data Structures and Algorithms, and Discrete Mathematics. I have developed skills in Python, Java, C, HTML, Javascipt, Numpy, PyTorch, Git, Pandas, and Windows.

    In my spare time, I practice taekwondo, play piano, learn to bake different desserts!
